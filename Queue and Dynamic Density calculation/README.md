## Steps to run the code of Part2:
1. To run the code, open the Directory in which **assignment1_2.cpp** file is present.
2. Put the videos whose Queue Density and Dynamic Density needs to be found in the same directory as assignment1_2.cpp
3. Launch terminal in that directory.
4. Give the `make all` command. This should produce a binary file named "part2" in the same directory.  
(Make sure the **Makefile** is present in the directory)
5. Now run the command `./part2 <file_name>` . Replace <file_name> with the name of your video file.
6. **You should see the output in a "out.txt" file.** This out.txt has three entries namely Frame number, Queue density, Dynamic density which denote the respective values in this order.
7. Run `make clean` to delete the part2 file.
